# YouTube-to-MP3 converter #

This is my personal implementation of a YouTube-to-MP3 converter using **[pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)**.  
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Installing **[pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)** ###
Install directly from source to get newest version. Recommended as new bugs appear quite frequent in my experience. 
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/pytube/pytube
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Usage ###
Put urls linewise in "urls.txt" and simply run the script.
```bash
python yt-dl.py
```
Comments are allowed in "urls.txt". They must start with "#" or "!".
